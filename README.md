# Adding your thing to the list

## Link to your own repo

If your thing is already online, just link to it. Either:

1. Edit this README with a link to your thing.
  - Create a new section if it makes sense.
2. Mail me or post a link on [the forum](https://forum.johnnydecimal.com) and I'll link it for you.

## Add it to this repo

If you'd prefer it included directly here, either:

1. Send a pull request to this repo with your thing.
  - Put it in its own folder with a descriptive name.
2. Mail your thing to me, and I'll add it.
  - Let me know if you'd like to be credited as the author (default: yes, by name, no email address shown).
  - Everything added to this repo becomes MIT-licensed.

Thanks!

## Desktop utilities

### Platform-Agnostic

- [SwissArmyWrench/johnnybgoode](https://github.com/SwissArmyWrench/johnnybgoode): A cross-platform terminal tool to jump between your JD folders and export an index, instantly.

### Linux

- [bminusl/ulauncher-jd](https://github.com/bminusl/ulauncher-jd): [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) extension for the Johnny Decimal filing system. 

### macOS

- [bsag/alfred-jd](https://github.com/bsag/alfred-jd): First! 🥳 An [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) workflow to jump straight to the JD folders on your filesystem.

### Windows

- [Johnny.Decimal folders normalization tool](https://github.com/EvgenyVenalainen/jd-folders-tool)
  - This application was intended to quickly change a number in the folder names according to JD system; a user could easily change names of folders and not keep the correspondence between different folder levels. The application being launched inside the root folder will recover folder name consistency.

## Web utilities

- [johnny-decimal-generator](https://johnny-decimal-generator.netlify.app/) is a web application that lets you create an index map (@emory: up to 9 areas) and the [johnny-decimal-generator repository](https://github.com/ekafyi/johnnydecimal-index-generator), ~~maintained by [ekafyi](https://github.com/ekafyi/)~~ no longer maintained.
  - **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️** This tool stores everything in your browser's local storage. So if you clear that, or if you use this in a private/incognito window, **it is easy to lose your work**.
