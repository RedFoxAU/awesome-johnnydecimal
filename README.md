# Adding your thing to the list

## Link to your own repo

If your thing is already online, just link to it. Either:

1. Edit this README with a link to your thing.
  - Create a new section if it makes sense.
2. Mail me or post a link on [the forum](https://forum.johnnydecimal.com) and I'll link it for you.

## Add it to this repo

If you'd prefer it included directly here, either:

1. Send a pull request to this repo with your thing.
  - Put it in its own folder with a descriptive name.
2. Mail your thing to me, and I'll add it.
  - Let me know if you'd like to be credited as the author (default: yes, by name, no email address shown).
  - Everything added to this repo becomes MIT-licensed.

Thanks!
